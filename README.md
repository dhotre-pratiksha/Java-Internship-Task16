Java Internship Task 16 – Executor Framework Task Scheduler

This project demonstrates:
- Task scheduling using ExecutorService
- Fixed thread pool creation
- Runnable vs Callable tasks
- Future for monitoring task execution
- Handling task failures
- Graceful executor shutdown
- Performance comparison with traditional threads

This task helped me understand scalable and efficient thread management in Java.
